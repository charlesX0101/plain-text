# Guest Wi-Fi setup and safe network sharing

## Introduction
A guest Wi-Fi network is a separate wireless network that allows visitors to connect to the internet without giving them access to your main devices or files. It keeps your personal network secure while still letting others use your internet. Setting up a guest network is quick, but doing it properly ensures your home or office stays protected.

## Why use a guest network
- **Protects personal devices**: Guests cannot see or connect to your computers, smart TVs, or storage drives.
- **Prevents malware spread**: If a guest’s device is infected, it cannot reach your main network.
- **Keeps bandwidth in check**: Some routers allow you to limit speed or prioritize your own devices.
- **Convenience**: Guests do not need your main Wi-Fi password.

## How to set up a guest network
1. **Log into your router**
   - Open a web browser and enter your router’s IP address (often 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.1.1).
   - Sign in with your admin username and password.

2. **Find guest network settings**
   - Look for a section labeled “Guest Network” or “Wireless Guest Access.”
   - Some routers may require enabling this feature.

3. **Name the network**
   - Choose a clear name (SSID) so guests know which one to join, such as “Guest-WiFi.”
   - Do not use the same name as your main network.

4. **Set a password**
   - Even a guest network should use WPA2 or WPA3 encryption.
   - Use a different password from your main Wi-Fi.

5. **Restrict access**
   - Enable isolation so devices on the guest network cannot talk to each other or to devices on your main network.
   - Limit bandwidth if your router supports it.

6. **Save and test**
   - Connect a phone or laptop to the guest network.
   - Confirm that you can access the internet but cannot reach shared drives or printers on your main network.

## Safe network sharing practices
- **Do not share your main Wi-Fi password**: Keep it private to protect all your devices.
- **Change guest passwords periodically**: This prevents old visitors from lingering on your network.
- **Use QR codes for easy connection**: Some routers and phones can generate a QR code for guests to scan instead of typing a password.
- **Monitor connected devices**: Your router’s admin page can show who is connected. Disconnect unknown devices if needed.

## Advanced options
- **Separate VLANs**: Some advanced routers or mesh systems allow you to fully isolate guest traffic on its own network segment.
- **Timed access**: Set the guest network to turn off automatically after certain hours or days.
- **Captive portal**: Some routers support a sign-in page for guests before they connect, useful in small businesses.

## Summary
A guest Wi-Fi network offers visitors internet access while keeping your personal network safe. By isolating guest devices, using a unique password, and monitoring access, you can share your connection without exposing your devices or files. It is a small setup step that adds a big layer of security.
