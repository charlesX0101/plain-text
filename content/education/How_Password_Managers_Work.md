# How password managers actually work (and how to pick one)

## Introduction
A password manager is a tool that stores your login credentials in an encrypted database, so you can use strong, unique passwords without having to remember them all. It acts as both a secure vault and a password generator. Understanding how they work helps you choose one confidently and use it safely.

## How password managers work
1. **Vault creation** 
   When you set up a password manager, it creates a secure vault file. This file is stored locally, in the cloud, or both. The vault is locked with a *master password* that only you know.

2. **Encryption and decryption** 
   The vault is encrypted using strong cryptographic algorithms, often AES-256. The encryption key is derived from your master password using a key-stretching function such as PBKDF2, Argon2, or scrypt. 
   - When you unlock the vault, the manager uses your master password to generate the key and decrypt the contents. 
   - When you lock it, the contents are re-encrypted and the key is discarded from memory.

3. **Data storage** 
   Inside the vault, each entry usually contains:
   - Website or service name
   - Username or email
   - Password
   - Optional notes or security questions

4. **Autofill and integration** 
   Password managers can integrate with browsers or apps to autofill login fields. This is usually done through an extension or API. Some also auto-type credentials into applications.

5. **Password generation** 
   Most managers include a generator that can create random passwords with specified length and character sets. Because the manager stores them for you, they can be long and complex.

6. **Synchronization** 
   Cloud-based managers sync your vault across devices via encrypted transfers. Zero-knowledge architecture means the service cannot see your data because only your master password can decrypt it. Local-only managers avoid the cloud but require manual vault transfers or sync via secure storage.

## Key concepts
- **Master password**: The single most important password you will need to remember. It must be long, unique, and never reused.
- **Zero-knowledge**: A design where the provider cannot decrypt your vault even if they wanted to.
- **Two-factor authentication (2FA)**: Adds another layer of security for unlocking your vault.
- **Offline mode**: Allows access to your stored passwords without internet connectivity.

## How to choose a password manager
1. **Security design** 
   Look for published details about encryption algorithms, key derivation functions, and whether the service uses zero-knowledge storage.

2. **Cross-platform compatibility** 
   Ensure it works on all your devices (Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS) and in the browsers you use.

3. **Ease of use** 
   A password manager should be simple to set up, with clear ways to add, retrieve, and update credentials.

4. **Data portability** 
   The ability to export your vault in an encrypted form means you are not locked into one provider.

5. **Offline access** 
   Make sure you can still get to your passwords without a network connection.

6. **Cost and licensing** 
   Some are free and open-source, some are paid services. Free does not always mean insecure, but paid services may offer more convenience features.

7. **Audit and transparency** 
   Preference should go to tools with independent security audits and published technical documentation.

## Practical tips
- Never store your master password inside the manager itself.
- Use 2FA where possible, but not SMS-based codes if you can avoid it.
- Backup your vault securely. For local vaults, keep encrypted copies in more than one place.
- Periodically review stored accounts and remove old or unused entries.

## Summary
A password manager is essentially an encrypted vault that holds your credentials, unlocked only with your master password. It allows you to maintain strong, unique passwords for every account without relying on memory or insecure reuse. Choosing one comes down to understanding its security model, compatibility, and usability. With proper setup and use, a password manager can significantly reduce the risk of compromised accounts.
