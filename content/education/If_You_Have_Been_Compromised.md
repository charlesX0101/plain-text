# What to Do If You Have Been Compromised: A Guide to Recovering from Digital Scams

Falling victim to a digital scam can be stressful, but fast, informed action can limit damage and help you recover. Whether someone has gained access to your accounts, stolen personal information, or tricked you into sending money, the steps below will help you regain control.

## 1. Stay Calm and Assess the Situation
- Identify what was compromised: account credentials, financial information, personal data, or your device itself.
- Take notes on what happened, including messages, links, or phone numbers involved. This will help in reports and investigations.

## 2. Secure Your Accounts
1. **Change Passwords Immediately**
   - Start with your email account. If attackers control your email, they can reset other account passwords.
   - Use strong, unique passwords for each account.
2. **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
   - Adds a second layer of protection in case your password is known.
3. **Log Out of All Sessions**
   - Most services offer a “log out everywhere” or “sign out of all devices” option.

## 3. Protect Your Financial Information
- Contact your bank or credit card provider to report the compromise.
- Freeze your credit with credit bureaus if sensitive personal data (like your Social Security number) was exposed.
- Monitor statements for unauthorized charges and dispute any immediately.

## 4. Clean and Secure Your Devices
- Run a full antivirus or anti-malware scan.
- Update your operating system and applications to close security holes.
- Remove unknown apps, browser extensions, or software you did not install.
- If a device shows persistent suspicious behavior, consider a full system reset after backing up your files.

## 5. Report the Incident
- **Email or account compromise**: Contact the service provider’s support and security team.
- **Financial fraud**: File a report with your bank and, if applicable, with your country’s cybercrime agency (in the US, report to the FTC and IC3.gov).
- **Identity theft**: Use identity theft recovery resources (in the US, IdentityTheft.gov).
- Keep copies of all reports and correspondence.

## 6. Warn and Protect Others
- Notify contacts if scam messages might have been sent from your account so they do not click on suspicious links.
- Share only the facts needed for them to protect themselves.

## 7. Strengthen Your Defenses
- Use a password manager to store and generate strong passwords.
- Keep backups of important files offline or in a secure cloud.
- Regularly review security settings on all accounts.
- Learn to recognize phishing, smishing, and other common scams to avoid future incidents.

## 8. Key Points
- Quick action limits damage after a compromise.
- Securing your email account is a top priority.
- Notify banks and freeze credit if sensitive financial or identity information is exposed.
- Scan and update devices to remove any malware.
- Report the scam to appropriate authorities and service providers.

## 9. Summary
Being compromised online is serious but recoverable if handled promptly. Start by regaining control of your accounts, securing finances, and cleaning your devices. Reporting the incident and learning from it will reduce the chances of it happening again and help you respond faster if it does.
