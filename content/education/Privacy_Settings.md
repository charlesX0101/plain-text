# Privacy settings walkthrough: Google, Apple, Microsoft

## Introduction
Major tech companies collect data from your devices and accounts to provide services, personalize content, and deliver ads. While some data collection is unavoidable, each platform offers privacy controls that let you limit what is stored, shared, or tracked. This guide walks through key settings for Google, Apple, and Microsoft accounts so you can make informed choices.

## Google
Google services include Gmail, YouTube, Google Drive, Android devices, and more. Most privacy settings are managed through your Google Account dashboard.

### 1. Access the privacy dashboard
- Go to https://myaccount.google.com
- Sign in and navigate to **Data & Privacy**

### 2. Web & App Activity
- Found under **History Settings**.
- Turn off if you do not want Google to store searches, app activity, and location info.
- You can still use services without saving history.

### 3. Location History
- Controls whether Google tracks your location across devices.
- Turn off to stop ongoing tracking.
- Use **Manage Activity** to delete past location data.

### 4. YouTube History
- Separate controls for search history and watch history.
- Turning off prevents recommendations based on viewing habits.

### 5. Ad Personalization
- Found under **Ad Settings**.
- Turn off to prevent Google from tailoring ads based on your activity.
- You will still see ads, but they will be less targeted.

### 6. Security checkup
- In **Security**, review devices, recent activity, and connected apps.
- Remove anything unfamiliar.

## Apple
Apple devices and services include iCloud, iPhone, iPad, and Mac computers. Apple emphasizes on-device processing but still collects data for iCloud and analytics.

### 1. Review Privacy in Settings (iOS/iPadOS)
- Open **Settings > Privacy & Security**
- Check **Location Services**: Turn off for apps that do not need it, or set to "While Using."
- Review **Tracking**: Disable "Allow Apps to Request to Track" to block cross-app tracking.

### 2. Analytics & Improvements
- In **Settings > Privacy & Security > Analytics & Improvements**, turn off sharing iPhone analytics and usage data with Apple.

### 3. iCloud Data
- In **Settings > [Your Name] > iCloud**, review what data is synced.
- Turn off sync for items you do not want stored in iCloud.
- Use **Manage Account Storage** to delete old backups you no longer need.

### 4. Safari Privacy
- In **Settings > Safari**, enable **Prevent Cross-Site Tracking** and **Block All Cookies** (if you can live with the trade-offs).
- Clear history and website data periodically.

## Microsoft
Microsoft services include Windows, Office, OneDrive, and Xbox. Windows 10 and 11 have multiple privacy options.

### 1. Windows Privacy Settings
- Open **Start > Settings > Privacy & Security**.

### 2. Diagnostic Data
- Under **Diagnostics & Feedback**, set to **Required diagnostic data** instead of optional.
- Turn off **Tailored experiences** to stop using diagnostic data for personalization.

### 3. Activity History
- Under **Activity History**, uncheck "Store my activity history on this device" and "Send my activity history to Microsoft" if not needed.
- Clear past activity history.

### 4. Location
- Under **Location**, turn off for the entire device or for specific apps.
- Clear location history periodically.

### 5. Advertising ID
- Under **General**, turn off "Let apps show me personalized ads by using my advertising ID."

### 6. App Permissions
- Review permissions for Camera, Microphone, Contacts, Calendar, etc.
- Disable access for apps that do not require it.

## Tips for all platforms
- **Review settings regularly**: Companies update policies and features, sometimes adding new tracking defaults.
- **Use strong account security**: Enable two-factor authentication to protect account access.
- **Be mindful of app permissions**: Both mobile and desktop apps can request more data than they need.
- **Delete old data**: All three platforms let you remove stored history and files you no longer want.

## Summary
Google, Apple, and Microsoft all provide privacy controls, but they are not always obvious or set to maximum privacy by default. Taking time to adjust settings, limit data collection, and review permissions puts more control in your hands and reduces the personal information these companies store about you.
