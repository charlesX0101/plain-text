# Teaching others: helping non-tech users without taking over

## Introduction
Helping someone with technology is not just about fixing a problem for them. The real value comes from guiding them so they can understand and do it themselves next time. This approach builds confidence and reduces dependence, while also respecting their pace and comfort level.

## Why this matters
- Encourages self-reliance instead of dependency
- Builds long-term skills instead of quick fixes
- Respects the other person’s sense of ownership over their device
- Reduces repeated calls for the same problem

## Principles for effective tech teaching
1. **Ask before acting** 
   Do not grab the device and start clicking. Ask what they want to do and what they have already tried.

2. **Use their language** 
   Avoid jargon unless you explain it. Replace “authenticate to the server” with “log in to the system.”

3. **Explain your actions** 
   Narrate what you are doing in plain language, and connect it to the reason why. For example: 
   “I’m opening Settings so we can see the Wi-Fi options.”

4. **Let them drive** 
   When possible, have them hold the mouse, type on the keyboard, or tap the screen while you give step-by-step guidance.

5. **Break tasks into steps** 
   Give one instruction at a time and wait until they complete it before moving to the next.

6. **Encourage questions** 
   Make it clear there are no “stupid” questions. If they hesitate, prompt gently: 
   “Does that make sense so far?”

7. **Relate to what they know** 
   Use analogies to familiar activities. Example: “This folder is like a filing cabinet drawer.”

8. **Avoid information overload** 
   Focus on the goal at hand. Save extra tips for later once they are confident.

9. **Be patient with mistakes** 
   Let them try again without rushing in to correct them unless it will cause harm to the system.

10. **Leave behind a simple reference** 
    Write down the key steps or show them where to find a guide so they can review later.

## Practical example
Instead of:
- Taking the device and setting up email for them 
Do:
- Walk them through opening the email app, entering account details, and sending a test email 
- Explain what each field means so they can repeat the process later

## Common pitfalls to avoid
- **Taking over control** because it is faster
- **Talking too fast** or skipping steps
- **Using only your own shortcuts** instead of the menu paths they can see
- **Making them feel incompetent** through tone or impatience

## Summary
Helping non-tech users is about empowerment, not speed. By letting them do the work with your guidance, using clear explanations, and giving them tools to remember the process, you turn a one-time fix into a lasting skill. The goal is to make them confident enough to try on their own next time.
