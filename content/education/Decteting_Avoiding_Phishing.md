# Detecting and Avoiding Phishing, Scam Emails, and Smishing

Phishing is when someone tries to trick you into giving away personal information, money, or access to your accounts. It usually comes as an email, text message, or social media message pretending to be from a trusted source. Smishing is phishing over SMS or messaging apps. These scams can look convincing, but they have telltale signs.

This guide explains how to spot these scams and avoid falling victim.

## 1. Common Signs of Phishing or Scam Messages

1. **Urgent or Threatening Language** 
   Messages that demand immediate action, threaten account closure, or claim you will be fined are designed to scare you into reacting without thinking.

2. **Too Good to Be True Offers** 
   Promises of large sums of money, prizes, or rewards for little or no effort are a red flag.

3. **Suspicious Links** 
   Links that do not match the sender’s website, have strange spellings, or use shortened URLs to hide the real address.

4. **Unfamiliar Senders** 
   Emails or texts from unknown addresses or numbers, especially if they claim to be from banks, delivery companies, or government agencies.

5. **Poor Grammar or Spelling** 
   Many scams contain awkward language, strange phrasing, or obvious errors.

6. **Requests for Sensitive Information** 
   Legitimate companies do not ask for passwords, full credit card numbers, or PINs over email or text.

## 2. How to Check if a Message is Legitimate

1. **Inspect the Sender Address** 
   Look at the full email address, not just the display name. Fraudulent addresses often look similar to real ones but with extra characters or misspellings.

2. **Hover Over Links Before Clicking** 
   On a computer, hover over the link to see the real destination. On mobile, press and hold (without tapping) to preview it.

3. **Contact the Company Directly** 
   Use a verified phone number or website. Do not reply directly to the suspicious message.

4. **Search for the Exact Message** 
   Copy a part of the email or text and search online. Many scams are reported publicly.

5. **Check Your Account Directly** 
   If the message claims there is a problem, log in to your account using a bookmark or by typing the address yourself, not through the link in the message.

## 3. Avoiding Phishing and Smishing Attacks

1. **Enable Spam and Fraud Filters** 
   Most email services and carriers offer filtering tools that catch common scams.

2. **Do Not Click Unknown Links** 
   If you are unsure about a link, visit the site manually instead.

3. **Never Send Sensitive Information Over Email or SMS** 
   Use secure, official channels only.

4. **Use MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)** 
   Even if someone gets your password, MFA can stop them from accessing your account.

5. **Keep Software and Devices Updated** 
   Updates often include security patches that help protect you.

## 4. What to Do If You Think You’ve Been Targeted

1. **Do Not Respond** 
   Delete the message or mark it as spam.

2. **Report It** 
   - Email scams: forward to your email provider’s abuse address (e.g., abuse@domain.com) or report through their spam button.
   - Text scams: forward to 7726 (SPAM) in the US.

3. **Run a Security Check** 
   Change passwords for affected accounts and check for unauthorized logins.

4. **Monitor Accounts Closely** 
   Watch for unusual charges, login alerts, or password reset requests.

## 5. Key Points

- Phishing and smishing rely on urgency, fear, or greed to get you to act quickly.
- Always verify a message through official channels before clicking links or sharing information.
- Use strong account security to reduce damage if a scam succeeds.
- When in doubt, delete the message and reach out to the company yourself.

## 6. Summary

Scam emails and texts are designed to look real, but they depend on you reacting before thinking. Slow down, verify the source, and use secure communication channels. Staying cautious and knowing the warning signs will keep you a step ahead of the scammers.
