# Device Upgrade Planning: How to Migrate Safely

Upgrading to a new computer, phone, or tablet can improve speed, features, and security, but it can also cause headaches if you lose data or access to important accounts. A safe migration requires planning, backups, and a clear checklist.

## 1. Prepare Before You Move

1. **Make a Complete Backup**
   - Computers: Use an external drive or backup software
   - Phones: Use cloud backups or local backup tools
   - Verify backups by checking that you can open and read some files

2. **Take Inventory of Apps and Licenses**
   - List installed programs and note any license keys or serial numbers
   - On phones, check which apps are linked to an account so they can be redownloaded easily

3. **Update Your Current Device**
   - Install system updates and app updates before starting
   - This can help with compatibility and ensure your final backup is complete

4. **Sign In and Sync Accounts**
   - For cloud services like email, calendars, and notes, make sure syncing is turned on so the latest data is stored online

5. **Collect Important Passwords**
   - Make sure you know login details for email, cloud storage, and any app that requires authentication
   - Consider using a password manager to store credentials securely

## 2. Transfer Data Safely

1. **Use Official Migration Tools When Possible**
   - Windows: PC Mover, Windows Backup, or OneDrive
   - macOS: Migration Assistant
   - iOS: Quick Start or iCloud restore
   - Android: Google Backup or manufacturerâ€™s transfer app

2. **For Manual Transfers**
   - Use a reliable external drive or network transfer
   - Keep copies on both devices until you confirm the migration worked

3. **Avoid Unverified Third-Party Tools**
   - They may be insecure or lose data during transfer

4. **Check for Encryption**
   - If moving sensitive files, ensure they are encrypted before transferring

## 3. After Migration

1. **Verify Data**
   - Check that documents, photos, and other important files are present and open correctly
   - Confirm that settings, bookmarks, and contacts transferred

2. **Reinstall and Activate Software**
   - Install necessary programs and re-enter license keys if required

3. **Test Peripherals**
   - Make sure printers, cameras, and other connected devices work on the new device

4. **Sign In to Accounts**
   - Log into email, cloud storage, messaging apps, and banking apps

## 4. Wipe the Old Device (If Selling or Recycling)

1. **Backup First**
   - Make sure you have all files you need
2. **Sign Out of All Accounts**
   - Prevents lockouts or future access issues
3. **Factory Reset or Secure Erase**
   - On computers, use the built-in reset function or disk-wiping tools
   - On phones, use the system reset from settings
4. **Remove SIM Cards and External Storage**
   - Keep these for reuse or dispose of them securely

## 5. Key Points

- Backups are the most important step before migrating
- Use official or well-supported tools for transfers
- Verify all data before erasing the old device
- Protect sensitive information during and after the migration

## 6. Summary

Device upgrades go smoothly when you plan ahead. Back up everything, keep important logins and licenses handy, use secure transfer methods, and double-check that all data made it to the new device. Only then should you securely erase the old one.
