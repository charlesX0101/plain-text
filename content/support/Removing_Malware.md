# Removing Malware or Fake Antivirus Software

## Introduction
Malware and fake antivirus software can slow your system, steal data, or lock you out of important files. Fake antivirus programs often display alarming messages to convince you to pay for "removal" of threats that do not exist. This guide covers how to remove such threats using built-in tools and safe practices.

## Step 1: Disconnect from the Internet
- Unplug the network cable or disable Wi-Fi to prevent further communication with malicious servers.
- This also stops the malware from downloading additional components.

## Step 2: Boot into Safe Mode
Safe Mode loads only essential system files, making it harder for malware to run.
- **Windows**:
  1. Hold Shift and click Restart from the Start menu.
  2. Choose Troubleshoot > Advanced options > Startup Settings > Restart.
  3. Select "Enable Safe Mode with Networking" if you need to download tools later.
- **macOS**:
  1. Shut down the Mac.
  2. Turn it on and immediately hold Shift until you see the login window.
  3. Log in; you are now in Safe Mode.

## Step 3: Use Built-in Security Tools
- **Windows**:
  1. Open Windows Security from the Start menu.
  2. Go to Virus & Threat Protection.
  3. Run a Full Scan. Remove or quarantine any threats found.
- **macOS**:
  macOS includes XProtect and Malware Removal Tool (MRT) which work automatically when the system is updated.
  1. Check for updates: Apple Menu > System Settings > General > Software Update.
  2. Install all available updates to trigger built-in malware removal.

## Step 4: Remove Suspicious Programs
- **Windows**:
  1. Open Settings > Apps > Installed Apps.
  2. Sort by install date to find recent, suspicious programs.
  3. Uninstall anything you did not intentionally install.
- **macOS**:
  1. Open Finder > Applications.
  2. Sort by date and look for unknown or suspicious apps.
  3. Drag them to Trash and empty it.

## Step 5: Check Browser Extensions and Settings
Malware often changes browser settings or adds extensions.
- Open your browserâ€™s extensions/add-ons page.
- Remove any you do not recognize.
- Reset the browser to its default settings if unsure.

## Step 6: Restore System Integrity
- **Windows**:
  1. Open Command Prompt as Administrator.
  2. Run `sfc /scannow` to repair system files.
- **macOS**:
  1. Restart into Recovery Mode (hold Command+R at startup).
  2. Use Disk Utility to run First Aid on your startup disk.

## Step 7: Enable Real-Time Protection
After removal:
- Ensure Windows Security real-time protection is on.
- On macOS, keep automatic updates enabled.

## Step 8: Monitor and Reset Passwords
- Change passwords for email, banking, and other sensitive accounts, ideally from a different clean device.
- Watch for suspicious activity on accounts.

## Key Points
- Disconnecting from the internet limits damage during cleanup.
- Safe Mode makes it harder for malware to run.
- Built-in tools like Windows Security and macOS MRT can handle many threats without third-party software.
- Browser changes often indicate lingering malware components.

## Summary
Removing malware or fake antivirus software requires immediate isolation of the system, use of safe startup modes, built-in scanning tools, and removal of suspicious programs. After cleaning, restore system integrity, enable real-time protection, and secure your accounts. This process helps ensure both system and personal data remain protected.
