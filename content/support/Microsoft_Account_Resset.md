# Microsoft Account Password Reset Failures

## Overview

Resetting your Microsoft account password should be simple. But sometimes, recovery fails. You don't get the reset code, identity verification doesn't work, or you're told "We couldn’t verify your identity."

This guide explains what to do when Microsoft’s password reset process doesn’t work and how to recover your account with minimal stress.

## Common Reasons Reset Fails

1. You no longer have access to the recovery email or phone number
2. You didn’t set up enough recovery options
3. You triggered suspicious activity flags (such as login from a new country)
4. You entered inaccurate or incomplete information during recovery
5. The account is too new or inactive to verify

If you're seeing messages like "We can’t verify you’re the account owner," you're in this situation.

## Step 1: Try the Standard Reset First

Go to:
https://account.live.com/password/reset

Choose "I forgot my password" and enter your email, phone number, or Skype name.

If you can receive a verification code via SMS or email, use it to reset the password.

If you don't receive the code:
- Check spam folders
- Confirm correct contact info
- Wait a few minutes and try again

If you don't have access to the recovery methods, click "I don’t have any of these."

## Step 2: Fill Out the Account Recovery Form

You’ll be redirected to:
https://account.live.com/acsr

Here, Microsoft asks for:

- The email address you’re trying to recover
- An alternate contact email they can reply to
- Account details only the real user would know

Examples of useful info to include:
- Past passwords
- Subject lines of recent emails
- Contact names from Outlook
- Xbox or Microsoft Store purchase history
- Skype contacts
- Approximate account creation date
- Devices or locations used to sign in

Be as accurate and detailed as possible. Do not guess if unsure.

Once submitted, you’ll get an email saying the request is being reviewed. This can take 24 hours or more.

## Step 3: Retry the Form if Denied

If you receive an email saying the recovery attempt failed:

- Double-check the form responses
- Add more details where possible
- Resubmit using the same alternate contact email

There is no limit to how many times you can retry, but submitting the same weak answers will keep getting denied.

Wait a few hours between attempts and revise your answers carefully.

## Step 4: Try Another Trusted Device

If you have a device where you were previously signed into the account:

- Try accessing Microsoft services like OneDrive or Outlook from that device
- Open Windows Settings > Accounts > Email & accounts to see if the account is listed
- Use that device to attempt reset again from a recognized session

Microsoft may allow password changes from familiar sessions without extra verification.

## Step 5: Check for Family or Linked Accounts

If this account was part of a Microsoft Family Group or linked to a work or school Microsoft tenant, an administrator may be able to help.

Ask someone in your family group or IT department to initiate recovery or reset.

## Step 6: Consider Waiting Before Retry

If too many failed recovery attempts have occurred, Microsoft may block further reset attempts temporarily.

If this happens:
- Stop trying for 24 to 48 hours
- Do not make additional recovery attempts during this window
- Return later with better prepared answers

## What If the Account Is Permanently Unrecoverable?

Microsoft will not reset accounts without enough proof of ownership. If all recovery options fail:

- Create a new Microsoft account
- Update associated services with your new login
- Change recovery methods on other accounts that used this email

While frustrating, this is Microsoft’s policy to prevent unauthorized access.

## Prevention for Next Time

1. Add multiple recovery options such as phone and secondary email
2. Set up security questions or verification via Microsoft Authenticator
3. Keep your recovery info up to date
4. Periodically test your recovery methods

## Summary

If password reset fails for your Microsoft account:

- Try standard reset via known phone or email
- Use the ACSR recovery form with detailed, accurate info
- Retry with stronger answers if denied
- Use trusted devices if available
- Wait before repeating failed attempts

If you’re locked out permanently, you may need to create a new account. Strengthen your recovery options right away to avoid repeat lockouts.
