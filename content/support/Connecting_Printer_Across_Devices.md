# Connecting a Printer Across Multiple Devices or Platforms

## Introduction
Many homes and offices need a single printer to work with multiple devices such as Windows PCs, Macs, iPhones, Android phones, and tablets. Modern printers often support several connection methods, including USB, Wi-Fi, Ethernet, and cloud printing. This guide explains how to set up a printer so it can be used from different devices and platforms without extra software.

## Step 1: Choose the Right Connection Method
- **USB**: Direct connection to one device only; not ideal for multiple devices unless shared through a computer.
- **Wi-Fi**: Allows all devices on the same network to print.
- **Ethernet**: Stable wired connection to the network; accessible by multiple devices.
- **Cloud Printing**: Enables printing over the internet; often requires creating an account with the printer manufacturer.

For multi-device access, Wi-Fi or Ethernet is preferred.

## Step 2: Connect the Printer to the Network
1. Power on the printer.
2. Use the printer’s control panel or touchscreen to navigate to Network or Wireless settings.
3. For Wi-Fi:
   - Select your Wi-Fi network.
   - Enter the password.
4. For Ethernet:
   - Connect the printer to the router with a network cable.
5. Print a network configuration page from the printer menu to confirm the IP address.

## Step 3: Add the Printer on Windows
1. Go to Settings > Devices > Printers & scanners.
2. Click Add a printer or scanner.
3. Select your printer from the list and click Add device.
4. If not listed, click The printer that I want isn’t listed, then choose Add a printer using a TCP/IP address, and enter the printer’s IP.

## Step 4: Add the Printer on macOS
1. Go to System Settings > Printers & Scanners.
2. Click Add Printer (+).
3. Select your printer from the list or choose IP to enter the printer’s IP address manually.
4. macOS will download and install the required drivers automatically.

## Step 5: Connect from iPhone or iPad
1. Ensure the printer supports AirPrint (most modern network printers do).
2. Open the document or photo you want to print.
3. Tap the Share icon > Print.
4. Select the printer from the AirPrint menu.

## Step 6: Connect from Android
1. Ensure the printer is on the same Wi-Fi network.
2. Open Settings > Connected devices > Connection preferences > Printing.
3. Enable the Default Print Service or install the printer’s official print service plugin from Google Play.
4. From an app, choose Print from the menu and select the printer.

## Step 7: Enable Printer Sharing from a Computer (If the Printer Is USB-Only)
If your printer is connected to one computer by USB:
- **Windows**:
  1. Go to Settings > Devices > Printers & scanners.
  2. Select the printer > Manage > Printer properties > Sharing tab.
  3. Enable Share this printer.
- **macOS**:
  1. Go to System Settings > Printers & Scanners.
  2. Select the printer > Options & Supplies > Sharing.
  3. Enable Printer Sharing.

## Step 8: Test Printing from All Devices
Print a test page from each device to confirm setup.
If printing fails:
- Check that all devices are on the same network.
- Verify printer IP address has not changed (consider setting a static IP).

## Key Points
- Network connection (Wi-Fi or Ethernet) is the easiest way to share a printer across platforms.
- AirPrint and Android Default Print Service make mobile printing straightforward.
- A USB-only printer can still be shared through a computer acting as the print server.
- Assigning the printer a static IP prevents future connection problems.

## Summary
By connecting your printer to a home or office network, you can enable printing from Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android without constant cable swapping. Using built-in printing services on each platform, combined with a stable network setup, ensures reliable access for all devices.
