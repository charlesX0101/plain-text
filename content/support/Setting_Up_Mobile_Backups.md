# Setting Up Backups on iPhone or Android

## Introduction
Regular backups protect your photos, contacts, messages, and other important data in case of loss, theft, or device failure. Both iPhone and Android devices include built-in backup options that can be set up without extra apps or costs. This guide explains how to enable and verify backups on both platforms.

## Step 1: Check Storage Availability
- **iPhone**: iCloud provides 5 GB free, with paid plans for more space.
- **Android**: Google Account includes 15 GB shared between Google Drive, Gmail, and Google Photos. 
If storage is full, you may need to upgrade or free up space before enabling backups.

## Step 2: Enable Backups on iPhone
1. Connect to Wi-Fi and ensure the device has sufficient battery (or plug it in).
2. Go to Settings.
3. Tap your name at the top, then tap iCloud.
4. Tap iCloud Backup.
5. Turn on iCloud Backup.
6. Tap Back Up Now to start the first backup.
7. Keep the device connected to Wi-Fi until the backup completes.

**What gets backed up**:
- Photos and videos (if iCloud Photos is enabled)
- App data
- Device settings
- Messages
- Health data

## Step 3: Enable Backups on Android
1. Connect to Wi-Fi and ensure the device has sufficient battery (or plug it in).
2. Open Settings.
3. Scroll to Google or Accounts and Backup (varies by brand).
4. Tap Backup or Backup and Restore.
5. Turn on Backup by Google One (or your phoneâ€™s manufacturer-specific backup option).
6. Tap Back Up Now to start the first backup.

**What gets backed up**:
- App data
- Contacts
- Call history
- Device settings (Wi-Fi passwords, wallpapers, etc.)
- SMS messages (on some devices)
- Photos and videos if Google Photos backup is enabled

## Step 4: Enable Photo and Video Backup
- **iPhone**:
  1. Go to Settings > [your name] > iCloud > Photos.
  2. Turn on iCloud Photos.
- **Android**:
  1. Open the Google Photos app.
  2. Tap your profile icon > Photos settings > Backup & sync.
  3. Turn on Backup & sync.

## Step 5: Verify Your Backup
- **iPhone**: 
```  
  Settings > [your name] > iCloud > iCloud Backup. Check the date of the last successful backup.
```
- **Android**: 
```
  Settings > Google > Backup. Check the date and time of the last backup.
```
## Step 6: Keep Backups Up to Date
- Ensure your device is regularly connected to Wi-Fi and charging for automatic backups.
- Perform a manual backup before major updates or traveling.

## Key Points
- Both iPhone and Android backups can be set up in minutes with built-in options.
- Backups work best over Wi-Fi with sufficient cloud storage space.
- Verifying backups ensures your data is actually being saved.
- Photos and videos may require enabling a separate backup option.

## Summary
Setting up backups on iPhone or Android is essential for protecting your data. By enabling the built-in cloud backup options, confirming photo and video backups, and checking backup dates regularly, you can ensure that your important information is safe and can be restored if your device is lost, stolen, or replaced.
