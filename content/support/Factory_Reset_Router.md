# Factory Resetting Your Router Safely

## Introduction
A factory reset restores your router to its original settings, removing all custom configurations such as Wi-Fi names, passwords, and security settings. This is useful when troubleshooting persistent network problems, removing malware-infected firmware settings, or preparing the router for sale or transfer. Resetting should be done carefully to avoid unnecessary downtime or security risks.

## Step 1: Understand What a Factory Reset Does
- All custom settings are erased, including:
  - Wi-Fi SSID (network name) and password
  - Admin username and password
  - Port forwarding, firewall, and VPN configurations
  - Parental controls or custom rules
- The router will return to the default IP address, login, and configuration.

## Step 2: Gather Information Before Resetting
Before you reset, record important details:
1. Current Wi-Fi name and password.
2. Current admin username and password.
3. ISP connection type (DHCP, static IP, PPPoE) and any required credentials.
4. Special configurations like port forwarding or custom DNS.

Tip: If you have a backup/export option in the router’s settings, save a copy to restore later.

## Step 3: Identify the Correct Reset Method
Most routers have two reset options:
1. **Soft reset** — Triggered through the router’s web interface.
2. **Hard reset** — Using the physical reset button.

For a hard reset:
- Locate the small reset button, usually recessed on the back.
- You will need a paperclip or pin to press it.

## Step 4: Perform the Reset
**Soft Reset (Web Interface)**:
1. Connect to the router via Ethernet or Wi-Fi.
2. Log in to the admin page (commonly at 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.1.1).
3. Navigate to Administration or System tools.
4. Select Factory Reset or Restore Defaults, then confirm.

**Hard Reset (Physical Button)**:
1. Keep the router powered on.
2. Press and hold the reset button for about 10–30 seconds (check your manual for exact time).
3. Release the button and wait for the router to reboot.

## Step 5: Securely Reconfigure After Reset
1. Log in with the default credentials (often printed on the router).
2. Change the admin username and password to something strong and unique.
3. Set a secure Wi-Fi SSID and password (WPA2 or WPA3 encryption).
4. Reapply any special settings from your backup or notes.
5. Update the router’s firmware to the latest version.

## Step 6: Test the Network
- Confirm that the internet connection works.
- Test Wi-Fi coverage and ensure all devices can reconnect.
- Verify that any security settings and firewall rules are in place.

## Key Points
- A factory reset is irreversible and removes all custom settings.
- Always back up configurations or write down important settings beforehand.
- Immediately change the default admin credentials after resetting.
- Update firmware to protect against known vulnerabilities.

## Summary
Factory resetting a router is a straightforward way to resolve persistent network problems or prepare the device for a new user. By recording your settings in advance, using the correct reset method, and securing the router immediately after, you can reset safely without leaving your network exposed.
