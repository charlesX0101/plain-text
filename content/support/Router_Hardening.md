# Router Hardening: Changing Admin Login and Wi-Fi Security

## Introduction
Routers come with default admin credentials and Wi-Fi settings that are often easy for attackers to guess. Changing these defaults and enabling strong wireless security greatly reduces the risk of unauthorized access. This guide explains how to secure your router using only built-in settings.

## Step 1: Connect to the Router
1. Connect to your router via Ethernet or Wi-Fi.
2. Open a web browser.
3. Enter the router’s IP address (commonly 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.1.1) in the address bar.
4. Log in using the current admin username and password. These may be printed on the router or in the manual.

## Step 2: Change the Admin Login Credentials
1. Locate the Administration, Management, or System Settings section.
2. Change the admin username if the router allows it.
3. Create a strong, unique password with at least 12 characters, including uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
4. Save changes and log back in with the new credentials.

**Why this matters**: Default logins are widely known and posted online, making them an easy target for attackers.

## Step 3: Update Router Firmware
1. In the router’s settings, find the Firmware or Software Update section.
2. Check for updates and apply any available.
3. Allow the router to reboot after updating.

**Why this matters**: Firmware updates patch known security flaws.

## Step 4: Secure the Wi-Fi Network
1. Navigate to the Wireless or Wi-Fi settings.
2. Change the SSID (network name) to something unique that does not reveal your ISP, location, or router model.
3. Set Security Mode to WPA3 if available, otherwise use WPA2.
4. Create a strong Wi-Fi password similar in complexity to your admin password.
5. Save changes and reconnect your devices to the network using the new password.

## Step 5: Disable WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup)
1. Locate the WPS setting in the router menu.
2. Turn it off.
WPS can be exploited to gain access to the network.

## Step 6: Separate Guest and Main Networks
1. Enable Guest Network in Wi-Fi settings if available.
2. Use a different password for the guest network.
3. Restrict guest network access to the internet only (no access to local devices).

## Step 7: Optional – Hide the SSID
Some users choose to hide the network name from public view. This adds a small layer of obscurity but is not a replacement for a strong password.

## Step 8: Save and Reboot
Apply all changes and reboot the router to ensure settings take effect.

## Key Points
- Default router logins are easy targets; always change them.
- Strong Wi-Fi passwords and WPA3/WPA2 encryption protect against most intrusion attempts.
- Disabling WPS and using a guest network further reduces risk.
- Keeping firmware up to date closes known vulnerabilities.

## Summary
Changing the router’s admin credentials, enabling strong Wi-Fi security, and disabling insecure features are essential steps in hardening your home or office network. These changes make it significantly harder for unauthorized users to access your network or compromise your devices.
