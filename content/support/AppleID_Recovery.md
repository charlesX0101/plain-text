# Apple ID Recovery When Trusted Device Is Lost

## Overview

Apple’s security model centers heavily around trusted devices like iPhones, iPads, or Macs that have already been verified as yours. If you lose access to your trusted device and try to sign in on a new one, you may be blocked by two-factor authentication (2FA) with no clear way forward.

This guide walks you through recovering your Apple ID when you no longer have access to any trusted device.

## What You Need to Know

Apple uses several factors to confirm identity:

- Trusted phone numbers (SMS or call)
- Trusted devices (logged-in Apple hardware)
- Recovery keys (if enabled)
- Recovery contacts (if configured)

If you have none of these, your only option is initiating **Account Recovery**, which is slow but usually effective.

## Step 1: Try a Trusted Phone Number

If your Apple ID has a trusted phone number attached, you may still receive:

- A 6-digit 2FA code by SMS
- A call with a code or confirmation prompt

On a new device, enter your Apple ID and password. If prompted for a code, check if the SMS arrives.

If this works, you’ll be able to finish sign-in and manage your account.

## Step 2: Use Account Recovery

If you can’t receive a code and don’t have access to a trusted device, go to:

https://iforgot.apple.com

Enter your Apple ID email address and follow the prompts. You’ll be asked:

- What phone number is linked to the account
- Whether you remember the password
- If you have access to any other Apple devices

If nothing is available, Apple will start **Account Recovery**, which can take several days.

You’ll receive updates by email or SMS with instructions. This may include:

- Verifying a payment method previously used with Apple
- Confirming billing address or device info
- Waiting through a delay (typically 24 to 72 hours)

Be patient and check for instructions daily.

## Step 3: Check for Any Other Trusted Devices

Even if you lost your main phone or Mac, try:

- Old iPads or iPods you used to log in
- Family-shared devices where your account is still logged in
- Secondary Macs or phones you may have forgotten about

Go to https://appleid.apple.com and see if the device still appears. If so, you might be able to reauthorize from there.

## Step 4: Use a Recovery Contact (If Set Up)

If you previously configured a recovery contact in your iCloud settings (iOS 15+), they can help verify your identity.

Ask your contact to go to:

Settings > [Their Name] > Password & Security > Account Recovery

From there, they can generate a recovery code that you can enter during the recovery process.

## Step 5: What If You Used a Recovery Key?

If you manually enabled a Recovery Key (a 28-character alphanumeric code), you **must** provide it. If you lost it and have no other recovery method, Apple cannot help you recover the account.

Double-check any saved notes, password managers, or printed files where you might have stored the key.

---

## What Not to Do

- Do not attempt repeated failed logins. This can extend your recovery delay.
- Do not create a new Apple ID unless you’re ready to lose access to purchases, iCloud data, and app history.
- Do not rely on third-party tools or services claiming to bypass Apple ID locks. These are usually scams or illegal.

## After Recovery

Once you regain access:

1. Add at least two trusted phone numbers
2. Review and update your security questions if available
3. Add a recovery contact in iCloud settings
4. Consider saving your Recovery Key in a password manager or secure offline location

## Summary

If you lose access to your Apple trusted device, the best path to recover your Apple ID is:

- Try receiving a code by SMS
- Use https://iforgot.apple.com to start recovery
- Be prepared to verify personal or billing information
- Wait through the account recovery delay

Once back in, strengthen your recovery options to avoid getting locked out again.
