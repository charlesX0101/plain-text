# Fixing Failed Software Installations (Permissions or Antivirus Interference)

## Introduction
Software installations can fail for many reasons, but two common causes are insufficient permissions and interference from antivirus or security software. These problems can prevent the installer from writing files, creating folders, or making system changes. This guide explains how to troubleshoot and complete installations safely using built-in tools and settings.

## Step 1: Confirm System Requirements
Before making changes, ensure the software is compatible with your operating system version, architecture (32-bit or 64-bit), and hardware.

## Step 2: Run the Installer as Administrator
- **Windows**:
  1. Right-click the installer file.
  2. Select "Run as administrator".
- **macOS**:
  - If prompted for your username and password, enter an account with administrative rights.

Running with elevated permissions allows the installer to write files and modify system settings.

## Step 3: Check Disk Space
Insufficient storage can cause installations to fail partway through.
- **Windows**: Settings > System > Storage.
- **macOS**: Apple menu > About This Mac > Storage.
Free up space if needed before retrying.

## Step 4: Temporarily Disable Antivirus or Security Software
Security software can mistakenly block or quarantine parts of the installer.
1. Disconnect from the internet to reduce risk while antivirus is disabled.
2. Temporarily disable real-time scanning in your antivirus settings.
3. Run the installer.
4. Re-enable antivirus immediately after installation.

**Note**: Only disable antivirus when the software is from a trusted source.

## Step 5: Check Folder Permissions
If the installer fails to write to a folder:
- **Windows**:
  1. Navigate to the installation folder location.
  2. Right-click > Properties > Security tab.
  3. Ensure your user account has "Full control".
- **macOS**:
  1. Right-click the folder > Get Info.
  2. Under Sharing & Permissions, ensure your account has "Read & Write".

## Step 6: Clear Temporary Files
Corrupted temporary files can cause repeated failures.
- **Windows**:
  1. Press Win+R, type `%temp%`, press Enter.
  2. Delete all files in the folder.
- **macOS**:
  1. In Finder, select Go > Go to Folder.
  2. Enter `~/Library/Caches` and delete unneeded files.

## Step 7: Use Safe Mode for Installation
Safe Mode loads only essential system services, which can prevent other programs from interfering.
- **Windows**:
  1. Hold Shift while selecting Restart.
  2. Troubleshoot > Advanced options > Startup Settings > Enable Safe Mode.
- **macOS**:
  1. Restart and hold Shift until the login screen appears.

Run the installer in Safe Mode, then restart normally.

## Step 8: Check Installer Integrity
If the download is corrupted, the installation may fail.
- Compare the file’s checksum (if provided by the vendor) with the expected value.
- Re-download the installer from the official source.

## Step 9: Review Installation Logs
Some installers create logs that detail why they failed.
- Check the vendor’s documentation for log file locations.
- Look for error messages related to permissions or blocked files.

## Step 10: Contact Support
If all else fails:
- Provide the vendor’s support team with your OS version, error messages, and any log files.
- Mention if you have tried disabling antivirus and running as administrator.

## Key Points
- Permissions and antivirus settings are common barriers to installation.
- Running installers with admin rights and temporarily disabling security software can resolve many failures.
- Safe Mode is useful when background programs interfere.
- Always verify the installer’s integrity before making system changes.

## Summary
Failed software installations due to permissions or antivirus interference can often be resolved by running the installer with elevated privileges, adjusting folder permissions, disabling security software temporarily, and clearing temporary files. Following these steps systematically increases the chances of a successful installation while keeping your system secure.
