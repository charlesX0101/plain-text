# Cleaning Up a Slow Computer with Built-in Tools

## Introduction
A computer that once ran smoothly can slow down due to cluttered storage, too many background programs, or outdated system files. You do not always need third-party software to fix this. Both Windows and macOS provide built-in tools that can help you clean and optimize your system. This guide focuses on what you can do with the tools already included in your operating system.

## Step 1: Identify the Cause
Before making changes, check the system resource usage:
- **Windows**: Press Ctrl+Shift+Esc to open Task Manager. Look at CPU, Memory, and Disk usage tabs.
- **macOS**: Open Activity Monitor (Applications > Utilities). Check CPU and Memory tabs.
High usage by a single program can point to a specific problem.

## Step 2: Remove Unnecessary Startup Programs
Too many startup programs slow boot time and consume resources.
- **Windows**:
  1. Open Task Manager (Ctrl+Shift+Esc).
  2. Go to the Startup tab.
  3. Right-click unnecessary programs and choose Disable.
- **macOS**:
  1. Go to System Settings > General > Login Items.
  2. Remove unneeded items from the list.

## Step 3: Free Up Disk Space
Low storage can make your system sluggish.
- **Windows**:
  1. Open Settings > System > Storage.
  2. Use Storage Sense or click "Temporary files" to delete unneeded items.
  3. Run Disk Cleanup (type "Disk Cleanup" in the Start menu) and select files to remove.
- **macOS**:
  1. Go to Apple Menu > About This Mac > Storage > Manage.
  2. Use the built-in recommendations to optimize storage and delete large or unused files.

## Step 4: Uninstall Unused Applications
Removing programs you no longer use can improve performance.
- **Windows**: Settings > Apps > Installed Apps, then uninstall unused ones.
- **macOS**: Open Finder > Applications, drag unwanted apps to Trash, and empty it.

## Step 5: Run System Maintenance Tools
- **Windows**:
  1. Open Command Prompt as Administrator.
  2. Run `sfc /scannow` to check and repair system files.
  3. Run `chkdsk /f` (you may need to restart).
- **macOS**:
  1. Restart the Mac and hold Command+R to enter Recovery Mode.
  2. Use Disk Utility to run First Aid on your startup disk.

## Step 6: Keep the System Updated
- **Windows**: Settings > Windows Update > Check for updates.
- **macOS**: System Settings > General > Software Update.

## Step 7: Restart the Computer Regularly
A restart clears temporary files and resets background processes, improving performance.

## Key Points
- Identify if a single program is using too many resources before making system-wide changes.
- Disabling unnecessary startup items can have an immediate effect.
- Built-in cleanup and repair tools are safe to use and do not require extra software.
- Keeping the operating system updated ensures better stability and security.

## Summary
Cleaning up a slow computer does not require special software. Using only built-in tools, you can remove clutter, free up resources, and keep your system in good working order. These steps should be repeated every few months or whenever you notice performance issues.
