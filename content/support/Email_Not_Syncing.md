# Outlook or Gmail Not Syncing on Desktop/Mobile

## Introduction
When Outlook or Gmail stops syncing, you may miss important emails or calendar updates. Causes range from internet connectivity issues and incorrect account settings to temporary server outages. This guide explains how to troubleshoot syncing problems on both desktop and mobile using built-in tools and adjustments.

## Step 1: Check Internet Connection
- Confirm you have a working internet connection by loading a few websites.
- If you are on a slow or unstable connection, switch to another network or use mobile data.

## Step 2: Check Email Service Status
Sometimes the problem is on the provider’s side.
- Search “Gmail status” or “Outlook status” in a web browser to check official service health dashboards.
- If there is an outage, you may need to wait until it is resolved.

## Step 3: Refresh or Restart the App
- Close and reopen the Outlook or Gmail app.
- On mobile, swipe away the app from the recent apps list and reopen it.
- On desktop, fully quit the program and restart.

## Step 4: Verify Account Credentials
- Ensure your password is correct by logging into the email service via a web browser.
- If your account uses two-factor authentication, confirm you have the correct app password or verification method set up.

## Step 5: Check Sync Settings
- **Outlook (Windows desktop)**:
  1. File > Account Settings > Account Settings.
  2. Select your account, click Change, and verify sync settings.
- **Gmail (web)**:
  - Gmail syncs automatically in a browser, but if using it in an email client, check IMAP is enabled:
    1. In Gmail web settings, go to Forwarding and POP/IMAP.
    2. Ensure IMAP is enabled.
- **Outlook mobile app**:
  1. Tap your profile icon > Settings.
  2. Select your account and confirm sync options are enabled.
- **Gmail mobile app**:
  1. Open Gmail > Menu > Settings.
  2. Select your account and ensure “Sync Gmail” is checked.

## Step 6: Clear Cache and Temporary Data (Mobile)
- **Android**:
  1. Go to Settings > Apps > Outlook or Gmail.
  2. Tap Storage > Clear Cache.
- **iOS**:
  - There is no direct cache clear; instead, close and reopen the app or reinstall if needed.

## Step 7: Remove and Re-add the Account
If syncing still fails:
- Remove the account from the app or email client.
- Add it back, entering all credentials and enabling sync during setup.

## Step 8: Update the App or Client
- Check for updates via the Microsoft Store, App Store, Google Play, or your system’s software update tool.
- Install all available updates and restart the device.

## Step 9: Adjust Security or Firewall Settings
- Firewalls or antivirus software can block email sync.
- Temporarily disable them to test, then re-enable and adjust rules if necessary.

## Step 10: Reduce Sync Load
If your inbox is extremely large:
- In Outlook, adjust settings to download only recent mail (e.g., last 3 months).
- In Gmail, use filters and labels to reduce what needs to be synced.

## Key Points
- Always confirm the problem is not due to a service outage before troubleshooting locally.
- Correct account credentials and sync settings are essential.
- Removing and re-adding the account often fixes corrupted sync profiles.
- Updates can resolve compatibility issues with email servers.

## Summary
Email syncing issues in Outlook or Gmail often stem from network problems, incorrect settings, or outdated software. By checking service status, verifying account details, reviewing sync settings, and updating or reinstalling the app, most problems can be resolved without advanced intervention.
