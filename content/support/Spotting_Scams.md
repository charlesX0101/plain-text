# Spotting and Stopping Support Scams Targeting Seniors

## Introduction
Support scams trick people into thinking their computer, phone, or account has a serious problem that requires urgent help. Scammers often pretend to be from trusted companies, using pop-ups, phone calls, or emails to pressure victims into paying for fake services. Seniors are often targeted due to scammers assuming they may be more trusting or less familiar with these tactics. This guide explains how to recognize, avoid, and respond to such scams.

## Step 1: Recognize Common Scam Signs
- Unsolicited phone calls claiming to be from tech support, your bank, or government agencies.
- Pop-up messages warning of a virus or security breach, with a number to call.
- Emails claiming account compromise and urging immediate action.
- Requests for remote access to your computer or device.
- Demands for payment in gift cards, wire transfers, or cryptocurrency.

## Step 2: Understand What Real Companies Will Not Do
- They will not call you out of the blue to fix a problem you did not report.
- They will not ask for your password over the phone or in email.
- They will not demand payment through non-traditional methods like gift cards.

## Step 3: If You Receive a Suspicious Call or Message
1. Do not give out personal or financial information.
2. Hang up or close the message without responding.
3. If you are concerned it may be real, contact the company using a phone number from their official website, not one given in the message.

## Step 4: Handling Scam Pop-ups
- Do not click any links or call displayed numbers.
- On Windows: Press Ctrl+Shift+Esc, open Task Manager, and close the browser.
- On macOS: Press Command+Option+Esc, select the browser, and choose Force Quit.
- Restart your browser and clear history/cache to remove the pop-up.

## Step 5: Protect Against Future Scams
- Keep software and security updates current.
- Use built-in security tools such as Windows Security or macOS Gatekeeper.
- Install a reputable ad blocker to reduce malicious pop-ups.
- Set up multi-factor authentication on important accounts.

## Step 6: If You Think You Gave Access or Information
1. Disconnect from the internet immediately.
2. Run a full system scan using built-in security software.
3. Change passwords for important accounts from a secure device.
4. Contact your bank or credit card company if financial information was shared.

## Step 7: Report the Scam
- In the United States: Report to the FTC at reportfraud.ftc.gov.
- In other countries: Contact your national fraud reporting center or local law enforcement.

## Key Points
- Scammers rely on fear and urgency to pressure victims into quick action.
- Never provide personal or payment information to unsolicited callers or pop-ups.
- Confirm suspicious claims through official contact channels only.
- Quick action after a suspected scam can prevent further damage.

## Summary
Support scams are a growing threat, especially for seniors. Recognizing the warning signs, refusing to share information, and using official channels for verification are the best defenses. By staying alert and reporting scams, you help protect yourself and others from becoming victims.
