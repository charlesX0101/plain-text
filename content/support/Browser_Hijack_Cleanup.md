# Browser Hijack Cleanup and Restoring Default Search

## Introduction
A browser hijack occurs when unwanted software changes your browser’s homepage, default search engine, or settings without permission. This can lead to intrusive ads, tracking, and security risks. This guide explains how to clean up a hijacked browser and restore your preferred search engine using only built-in tools.

## Step 1: Disconnect from the Internet
Temporarily disconnect to prevent further malicious activity while you make changes.
- Turn off Wi-Fi or unplug the network cable.

## Step 2: Identify the Affected Browser(s)
Check all installed browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari) to see which ones have altered settings. Even if you only use one browser, others may have been changed.

## Step 3: Remove Suspicious Extensions or Add-ons
- **Chrome**:
  1. Menu (⋮) > More Tools > Extensions.
  2. Remove any unfamiliar or unwanted extensions.
- **Firefox**:
  1. Menu (☰) > Add-ons and themes > Extensions.
  2. Remove anything suspicious.
- **Edge**:
  1. Menu (⋯) > Extensions.
  2. Remove any unrecognized add-ons.
- **Safari (macOS)**:
  1. Safari > Settings > Extensions.
  2. Uninstall unwanted extensions.

## Step 4: Reset Homepage and Search Engine
- **Chrome**:
  1. Menu (⋮) > Settings.
  2. Search for "Search engine" and set your preferred provider.
  3. Under "On startup", set your desired homepage or "Open a new tab".
- **Firefox**:
  1. Menu (☰) > Settings.
  2. Search for "Search" and set your preferred provider.
  3. Under "Home", set your preferred homepage.
- **Edge**:
  1. Menu (⋯) > Settings.
  2. Search for "Search engine" and adjust accordingly.
  3. Set the startup page in the "Start, home, and new tabs" section.
- **Safari**:
  1. Safari > Settings > General.
  2. Set your desired homepage.
  3. In the Search tab, choose your preferred search engine.

## Step 5: Clear Browser Data
Remove cached files and cookies that may reload the hijack.
- Open Settings in your browser.
- Locate "Clear browsing data" or similar.
- Select Cookies, Cached images/files, and Site settings, then clear them.

## Step 6: Check for Suspicious Programs
- **Windows**:
  1. Settings > Apps > Installed Apps.
  2. Sort by install date and uninstall unknown programs.
- **macOS**:
  1. Finder > Applications.
  2. Sort by date and move suspicious apps to Trash.

## Step 7: Reset Browser to Default Settings
If changes return after cleanup:
- **Chrome**: Settings > Reset settings > Restore settings to their original defaults.
- **Firefox**: Menu > Help > More troubleshooting information > Refresh Firefox.
- **Edge**: Settings > Reset settings > Restore settings to their default values.
- **Safari**: Disable all extensions, clear history, and remove suspicious configuration profiles (System Settings > Privacy & Security > Profiles).

## Step 8: Reconnect and Test
Reconnect to the internet.
- Open the browser and confirm your search engine and homepage remain correct.
- Test multiple restarts to ensure changes stick.

## Step 9: Prevent Future Hijacks
- Only install extensions from trusted sources.
- Keep browsers and operating systems updated.
- Avoid clicking on deceptive pop-ups offering free software or "security scans".

## Key Points
- A browser hijack can affect multiple browsers at once.
- Removing malicious extensions and resetting settings usually resolves the issue.
- Uninstalling unknown programs at the OS level prevents reinfection.
- Regular updates and cautious browsing habits reduce future risk.

## Summary
Browser hijacks can be removed without special software by disabling or uninstalling suspicious extensions, resetting browser settings, and removing unknown programs. After restoring your preferred homepage and search engine, maintain good browsing practices to prevent it from happening again.
